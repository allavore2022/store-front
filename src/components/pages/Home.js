            <p class="m-3">Aloha gang! My name is Justina, I’m a mama of 2 keiki residing on Oahu, Hawaii. I have always been a creative soul, 
                and love making anything and everything from clothing to crafts to decor and jewelry. I have over 10 years of jewelry 
                making under my belt, but I wanted to branch out into creating other things as well. I’m a very busy mama, as I am also 
                the caretaker of my 104 year old great grandma, but always set time aside to do what I’m passionate about, which is 
                creating and making!
